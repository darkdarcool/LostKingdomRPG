how does range and stuff work?
the starter range is 1-5
then a random pick is deployed
if you score 1(low) you do very little damage.
if you score 5(high) you do a lot little damage.
in the inbetween, it is low to high.
You can lower your range SUPER RARLEY.
but you can increase your damage more often.
thats that
